You’ve been invited to participate in a HackerOne Pentest. 

The Pentest is set to start on **[Start Date]** and end on **[End Date]**. This engagement is anticipated to require **[X]** hours of testing by each tester. When the Pentest finishes, all testing must cease.

# Program Rules & Restrictions
 - Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
 - Follow HackerOne's [disclosure guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines).
 - Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
 - Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact. Reporting best practices are acceptable, but please submit missing best practices with a severity of "None" so that we can properly track each issue that is reported.
 
# Submissions

During a HackerOne Pentest, you should submit all findings and work directly with the HackerOne Team and customer to validate. If a finding is informational or a best practice, please submit with a severity of “None”. 

# Scope

The scopes are listed in the assets section below. More information on each scope, including the types of issues most interested in seeing, is available in each asset’s description. 

[Please provide complete URLs, a description of the asset, the technology stack and how to access if it would not be self explanatory] 

[This can be based off the scoping document]
 
# Documentation

[Please provide links to any documentation, architecture diagrams or any other context that would be helpful]

[Do note, we can also embed files directly into the policy page]

# Test Plan

During the testing window, you will be invited to a shared Slack channel that will be used to facilitate communication and testing effectiveness.

# Areas of focus 

[If there are any areas to focus on in particular or bug classes that should be given extra attention, please list details here] 

# Safe Harbor

Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct, and the customer will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, the customer will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
`,qte='# Overview - Pentest Details and Rules\n* The pentest team size is of `2 pentesters` `3 pentesters` `4 pentesters` `5 pentesters`\n* The pentest will have `Web Application Pentest` `API Pentest` `Infrastructure Pentest` `Mobile Application Testing` and `Thick Application Pentest` in scope. More details can be found in the next section `mandatory - remove out of scope assessments`\n* Any special instructions associated with the attack surface that might affect testing effort? `accessing through VPN, throttling, or accessing the application at specific times`\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n\n# This pentest will include the following assets in scope:\n___\n\n## Web Application Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n#### Web Application 1\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n* Short description of the functionality and business purpose of the application `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n* How many user roles? `mandatory if gray-box`\n* Self account creation or providing accounts `mandatory if gray-box`\n* How many pages/functions approximately? `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n\n[Add more Web Applications as required repeating the previous information]\n\n___\n\n## API Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n* API Documentation such as Swagger or Postman Collection etc. will be provided? `mandatory`\n* Number of API endpoints `mandatory`\n* Average number of parameters per API endpoint `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n* Number of user roles/types `mandatory if gray-box`\n\n___\n\n##External Infrastructure Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n* Number of IP Addresses in scope `mandatory` - Be specific in this, if it is an IP range write in the Netmask `/24` or `/16`. If the customer only indicates "full" range for X.X.X.X, we will assume it to be `/24` and indicate as such.\n* Average number of services live in each host (FTP, DNS, Web App, SSH etc.). `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n*Note: Only Live IPs is not enough. We need to know how many assets need to be scanned. If 300 Live IPs, the total IP addresses to scan could be 300 or 3000. The amount of time that it takes varies by quite a bit\n\n___\n\n## Mobile Application Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n#### Mobile Application 1\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n* Short description of the functionality and business purpose of the application `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n* Will you be providing a version of the mobile application with security controls disabled?

        sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the

        the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct,
        serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt
        existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly
        exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only
        small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become

- Summary: a high level overview in which you have to be verbose.
- Steps to reproduce: a step-by-step process that a human can use to reproduce the vulnerability. In this section, include any additional evidence word-for-word that may be present in the security vulnerability, such as URLs to execute a payload, HTTP requests, HTTP responses, or any other useful details that a human might need to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Impact: the impact that is described in the security vulnerability, plus the typical impact of the CWE category for the security vulnerability.

In the summary:
- use present tense
- use passive voice
- respond using Markdown
- use ## for Markdown headings
